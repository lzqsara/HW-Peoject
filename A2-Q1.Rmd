```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### 1.

```{r}
y <- c(9.8,11.0,13.2,15.1,16.0)
t <- 1:5
model1 <-lm(y~t)
summary(model1)
```
```{r}
model2 <-lm(log(y)~t)
summary(model2)
```
According to compare the R squared and adjusted R squared of two model, model 1 ($y=\beta_0+\beta_1^t$) has higher value of R squared and adjusted R squared than that of model 2($\log(y)=\log\beta_0+\beta_1t$). Therefore, model 1 fit the data best

### 2.

```{r}
model3 <- lm(y~t+I(t^2))
summary(model3)
```
```{r}
anova(model1,model3)
```
According to compare the R squared and adjusted R squared of model 1 and model 3, the values are similar (model 3 slightly higher than model 1). According to ANOVA, the p-value is larger than 0.05, so model 1 is better.
